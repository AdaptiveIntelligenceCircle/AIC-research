# Research Area: Introspective Systems

This document defines the **Introspective Systems research program** within AIC-research.
It corresponds to the folder `research_areas/introspective_systems/` and formalizes how an intelligent system can **observe, summarize, evaluate, and regulate its own behavior over time**.

Introspection here is treated as a **first-class system capability**, not a visualization or post-hoc explanation tool.

### Known Failure Modes

1. **Over-Reflection**

   * System becomes conservative or inactive

2. **Self-Confirmation Bias**

   * Introspection reinforces existing behavior

3. **Trace Explosion**

   * Introspection overhead overwhelms execution

4. **Illusory Understanding**

   * Summaries hide critical edge cases

These failures are treated as design constraints, not bugs.

## Closing Statement

Introspection is not a path to autonomy.

It is a mechanism for **restraint, correction, and long-term responsibility**.

A system that can change itself without understanding its own behavior should not be trusted.
