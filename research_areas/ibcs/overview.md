# Research Area: Introspective Systems

This document defines the **Introspective Systems research program** within AIC-research.
It corresponds to the folder `research_areas/introspective_systems/` and formalizes how an intelligent system can **observe, summarize, evaluate, and regulate its own behavior over time**.

Introspection here is treated as a **first-class system capability**, not a visualization or post-hoc explanation tool.

### Scope

Introspective systems are systems that maintain an internal representation of:

* their own behavior,
* their decision history,
* and the effects of their actions over time.

The goal is not self-awareness in a philosophical sense, but **operational self-knowledge** that enables control, rollback, and governance.

### Core Questions

* What should a system know about itself?
* How much introspection is sufficient?
* When does introspection become harmful?

---

## Closing Statement

Introspection is not a path to autonomy.

It is a mechanism for **restraint, correction, and long-term responsibility**.

A system that can change itself without understanding its own behavior should not be trusted.
