# Simulation and Sandboxing

AIC adheres to the principle:
> Simulation-first, deployment-last.

No research is deployed directly
to the social environment or humans
without first undergoing a controlled sandbox.

## Sandbox Principles

- Isolates the system from real-world impact
- Limits resources and scope of action
- Provides full logging for introspection

## Why Simulation is Important

- Allows discovery of dangerous behavior
- Avoids social consequences
- Allows lossless rollback

Sandboxing is not intended to prove a system is “good”,

but to find **where it fails**.
