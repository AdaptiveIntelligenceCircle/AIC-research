# Research Methodology

This section defines **how AIC-Research conducts research**, regardless of specific models, frameworks, or technologies.

AIC does not view AI merely as an object of observation,

but as **a system with behavior, responses, and the ability to self-transform**.

Therefore, AIC's research methodology:
- Is not linear
- Does not rely solely on benchmarks
- Does not assume the system is always "well-behaved"

The goals of research methodology in AIC are:
- To explore behavioral limits
- To detect failures early
- To maintain control throughout the research lifecycle
