# Rollback-Based Validation

Rollback in AIC is not an emergency mechanism,
but a **scientific tool**.

Every study must:
- Have a defined rollback point
- Have a defined safe state

## Role of rollback

- Observe behavior before complete failure
- Compare before/after states
- Prevent long-term bias accumulation

## Hard rule

A study that does not rollback

→ is not considered a safe study.
