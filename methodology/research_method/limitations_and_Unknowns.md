# Limitations and Unknowns

AIC acknowledges that there are limitations
that current research cannot overcome.

## Unknowns

- The true limits of introspection

- Long-term stability of adaptive behavior

- Social impact of over-trusting the system

## Principles of Honesty

- Do not conceal limitations

- Do not speculate beyond the data
- Do not promise absolute control

A study that does not specify limits is an incomplete study.
