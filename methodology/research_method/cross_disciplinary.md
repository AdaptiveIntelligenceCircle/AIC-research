# Cross-Disciplinary Grounding

AIC does not study AI in a vacuum.

All results are placed within the context of:
- Cognitive science
- Philosophy of consciousness and responsibility
- Systems security engineering
- Ethics of power

## Objectives

- Avoid reinventing the wheel
- Identify non-technical risks
- Keep AI within a socio-humanistic context

AIC considers the lack of cross-disciplinary grounding as a form of technical debt.
