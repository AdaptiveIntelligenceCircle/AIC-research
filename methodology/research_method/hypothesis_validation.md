# Hypothesis Validation

AIC considers all hypotheses to be **temporary and potentially false**.

No hypothesis is defended, simply because it is beautiful, logical, or popular.

## Principles

- The hypothesis must be refuted
- Counterexamples are as valid as confirmations

## Process

1. State the hypothesis clearly
2. Identify the failure conditions
3. Design a counterexample scenario
4. Observe actual behavior

If the system cannot prove the hypothesis false,
it is a sign that the **test design is not robust enough**, not that the hypothesis is true.
