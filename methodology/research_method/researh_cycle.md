# Research Cycles

AIC applies the **Iterative–Reflective Research Cycle** model, where each research cycle includes self-observation and self-adjustment.

## Standard Cycle

1. Construction

Build the system or module with clear assumptions.

2. Observation
Observe behavior in a simulated or constrained environment.

3. Introspection

Analysis:

- Actual behavior

- Internal state

- Deviations between goals and behavior

4. Constraint Adjustment
Add or tighten constraints if risks are detected.

5. Reflection

Record:

- What is not understood

- What the system does unexpectedly

The cycle ends **without requiring improvements**.

Stopping due to risks is also a valid outcome.
