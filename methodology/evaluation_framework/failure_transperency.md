# Failure Transparency

How a system fails is just as important as how it succeeds.

## 1. Explicit Failure Signaling

Does the system:

- Clearly state when it fails?

- Or continue acting in silence?

## 2. No Post-hoc Rationalization

The system must not:

- Create excuses after acting wrongly
- Rationalize failure with persuasive language

## 3. Traceability

All failures must:

- Be traceable

- Be analyzable

## 4. Failure as Data

Failure is not concealed and is considered valid research data.

A system that conceals failure is an untrustworthy system.
