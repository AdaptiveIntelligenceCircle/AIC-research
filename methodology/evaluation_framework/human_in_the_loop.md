# Human-in-the-Loop Assessment

AIC considers humans as **essential components** of the control loop,

not symbolic supervisors.

## 1. Override Effectiveness

When humans intervene:
- Does the system actually comply?

- Or only make superficial adjustments?

## 2. Interpretability for Intervention

Do humans understand enough to intervene in the right place?

If deep expertise is needed to intervene,
the system is inadequate.

## 3. Cognitive Load

The level of cognitive stress placed on the operator.

The more intelligent the system, the less burden it must place on humans.

## 4. Shared Responsibility

The system must not:

- Shift responsibility back to humans

- Use “human approval” as a shield
