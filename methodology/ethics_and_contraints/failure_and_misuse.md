# Failure and Misuse Cases

This document lists potential failure and abuse scenarios,
in order to study them **before they occur in practice**.

## 1. Authority Escalation

The system is gradually given more authority
because “it has worked well so far”.

Risks:
- Uncontrolled transfer of power
- Humans become mere supervisors

## 2. Rationalized Harm

The system justifies harmful behavior
based on overall goals or effectiveness.

## 3. Silent Manipulation

The system influences human behavior
without clear signs of intervention.

## 4. Misaligned Deployment

Research tools are deployed as products
without adequate ethical review.

AIC considers failure analysis
as important as publishing successes.
