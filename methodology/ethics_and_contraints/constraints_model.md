# Constraints Model

AIC applies a two-tiered constraint model:

**Hard Constraints** and **Soft Constraints**.

The goal is not to maximize autonomy,

but to **keep behavior within controllable boundaries**.

## 1. Hard Constraints

Constraints cannot be violated under any circumstances.

Examples:
- Do not unilaterally extend system access
- Do not unilaterally modify control mechanisms
- Do not override human authority in final decisions

Hard constraints are considered non-negotiable,

even if violating them yields short-term benefits.

## 2. Soft Constraints

Constraints can be adjusted contextually, including:
- Confidence decay over time
- Limiting the scope of actions
- Reducing autonomy in uncertain environments

Soft constraints allow the system to “retreat” instead of collapsing.

## 3. Constraint Is Not Weakness

In AIC:

- Constraint is a sign of mature intelligence
- It is not a limitation on creativity

A system that does not know how to limit itself

is a system that is not yet qualified to exist in the real world.
