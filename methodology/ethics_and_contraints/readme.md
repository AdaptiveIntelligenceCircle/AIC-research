# Ethics and Constraints

This section establishes **ethical, cognitive, and power boundaries** for the entire AIC-Research.

In AIC, ethics is not a final check (post-hoc compliance), but a **core architectural component** that shapes how systems are designed,
evaluated, and implemented.

AIC stems from a simple but firm premise:

> Intellectual capacity does not automatically equate to the power to act.

This directory aims to ensure that any research progress:

- Can be limited

- Can be reversed

- Can be rejected if it exceeds human limits

## Scope

- Fundamental ethical principles
- Hard/soft constraints
- Epistemic limits
- Failure and abuse scenarios
- Pre-research ethical self-assessment process

Ethics in AIC are not intended to make the system “better behaved”,

but to make the system **no more dangerous than humans can control**.
