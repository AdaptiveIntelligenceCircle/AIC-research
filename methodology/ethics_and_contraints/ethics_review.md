# Ethics Review Process

All research in AIC-Research

must go through an ethical review process before implementation.

## 1. Pre-Research Ethics Checklist

- Could this research cause unintentional harm?

- Is there a clear rollback mechanism?

- Do humans have the right to intervene?

## 2. Ethical Stop Conditions

Research must stop immediately when:

- The system is beyond control

- The core behavior cannot be explained

- Social risks outweigh scientific benefits

## 3. Continuous Review

Ethics is not a one-time process.

Every architectural change requires a reassessment.

## 4. Right to Refuse Publication

AIC recognizes the right to:

- Not publish
- Not open-source
- Not continue research

when doing so poses an unacceptable level of risk.

Ethics in AIC is not about protecting reputation,

but about protecting **people and the future of the social system**.
