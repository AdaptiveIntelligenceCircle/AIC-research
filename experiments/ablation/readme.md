# Ablation Studies

Ablation studies in AIC are conducted to understand **causal responsibility**
rather than performance contribution.

Instead of asking:
"What component improves accuracy?"

AIC ablation asks:
"What component prevents unacceptable behavior?"

## Scope

Typical ablations include:
- disabling trust evaluation
- removing introspection mechanisms
- simplifying ethical constraints
- replacing adaptive policies with static rules

## Evaluation Focus

Metrics emphasize:
- behavioral deviation
- ethical violation frequency
- recovery capability after failure
- trust degradation rate

Performance gains resulting from ablation are explicitly documented but not treated as improvements.
