# Simulation

Simulation is the primary environment for evaluating AIC systems.

It is used to expose:
- rare but high-impact failures
- ethical conflicts
- trust breakdown scenarios
- system refusal conditions

## Simulation Types

- human-in-the-loop scenarios
- adversarial agent interaction
- degraded system environments
- conflicting policy constraints

## Principle

Simulation is not designed to prove intelligence.

Simulation exists to identify:
- when the system must slow down
- when it must refuse to act
- when it must rollback decisions

All simulation outcomes, including catastrophic failures,
must be preserved and analyzed.
