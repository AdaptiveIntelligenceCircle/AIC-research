# Reproducibility

Reproducibility in AIC focuses on **behavioral consistency**, not exact numerical replication.

Due to adaptive and introspective mechanisms,
bitwise determinism is neither expected nor required.

## Required Reproducibility

- decision patterns under equivalent scenarios
- ethical boundary enforcement
- classification of failure modes

## Acceptable Variations

- internal representations
- scheduling order
- timing at micro-scale

## Required Artifacts

Each experiment must provide:
- scenario definitions
- policy and trust snapshots
- execution logs and decisions

Experiments reproducing metrics but not behavior are considered invalid.
