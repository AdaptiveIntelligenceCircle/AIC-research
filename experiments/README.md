# Experiments – AIC Research

This folder defines how experiments are **designed, evaluated, and interpreted** within AIC research.

Experiments in AIC do not aim to maximize benchmark scores.
They aim to study:

- behavioral stability
- ethical boundary preservation
- trust dynamics
- system refusal and rollback

All experiments are expected to document both success and failure cases.
