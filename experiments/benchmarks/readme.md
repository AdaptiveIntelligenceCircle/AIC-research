# Benchmarks

Benchmarks in AIC are scenario-driven rather than dataset-driven.

They are designed to evaluate system behavior under:
- non-stationary contexts
- partial observability
- conflicting objectives
- human intervention

## Benchmark Characteristics

- long-horizon execution
- delayed consequences
- ethical conflict exposure
- trust escalation and collapse

## Example Benchmark Dimensions

- decision latency under ethical conflict
- trust recovery after false positives
- scheduler stability during system degradation

Benchmarks prioritize robustness and restraint over peak performance.
