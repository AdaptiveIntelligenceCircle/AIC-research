# Synthetic Datasets

This folder contains synthetic datasets generated for controlled experiments.

Synthetic data in AIC is not used to simulate realism,
but to isolate specific system properties.

## Design Principles

Synthetic datasets are designed to:
- expose ethical edge cases
- induce trust degradation or escalation
- test scheduler behavior under constraint
- create repeatable conflict scenarios

## Examples

- synthetic trust decay sequences
- fabricated ethical dilemmas
- controlled system overload events
- adversarial input patterns

## Limitations

Synthetic datasets are not intended to:
- represent real-world distributions
- replace real operational data
- optimize statistical performance

They are analytical tools, not substitutes for reality.
