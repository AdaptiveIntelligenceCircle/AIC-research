# Datasets – AIC Research

This folder contains datasets used for evaluating AIC systems.

Unlike conventional AI datasets, AIC datasets are not designed
to train perception models or maximize accuracy.

They are intended to:
- study system behavior
- analyze ethical decisions
- trace trust evolution
- evaluate rollback and refusal mechanisms

Datasets here may contain structured logs, synthetic scenarios,
and system-generated traces.
