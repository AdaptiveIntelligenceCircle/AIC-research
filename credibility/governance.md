## File: `governance.md`

### Purpose

To define **decision authority and responsibility** within AIC-research.

### Governance Model

* Benevolent but accountable maintainer model
* Decisions are explained, not imposed

### Decision Criteria

* Research coherence
* Safety and ethical impact
* Long-term maintainability
* Alignment with stated research principles

### Conflict Resolution

* Technical arguments over authority
* Written rationale for major decisions
* Archival of dissenting views when relevant

Governance is designed to scale cautiously, without diluting responsibility.

## Closing Note

Credibility in AIC-research is not derived from prestige.

It is built from:

* Explicit responsibility
* Transparent failure
* Verifiable systems
* Long-term consistency

If this research is wrong, it should be possible to show *where*, *why*, and *how*.
