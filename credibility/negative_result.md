# Credibility Layer – AIC-research

This document defines the **credibility framework** of AIC-research.
It replaces implicit trust with explicit structure, traceability, and long-term accountability.

---

## File: `negative_results.md`

### Purpose

To preserve and expose **what did not work**, and why.

### Philosophy

Negative results are not mistakes to be hidden, but information that prevents repetition of errors.

### What Is Documented

* Failed architectural approaches
* Abandoned algorithms
* Incorrect assumptions
* Control mechanisms that caused instability

### Usage

Negative results may:

* Be cited in papers
* Inform design constraints
* Shape future research questions

This file exists to resist survivorship bias.

## Closing Note

Credibility in AIC-research is not derived from prestige.

It is built from:

* Explicit responsibility
* Transparent failure
* Verifiable systems
* Long-term consistency

If this research is wrong, it should be possible to show *where*, *why*, and *how*.
