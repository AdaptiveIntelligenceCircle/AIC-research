### Purpose

To clarify **who is responsible for this research**, without relying on institutional branding or personal hype.

### Author Positioning

AIC-research is initiated and maintained by an independent system engineer and researcher.

The author operates at the intersection of:

* Systems engineering (OS, runtime, distributed systems)
* Adaptive and introspective AI
* Security-oriented thinking
* Philosophy of control and responsibility

### What the Author Claims

* Direct responsibility for architectural and research decisions
* Ownership of both successes and failures
* Commitment to publish negative results and limitations

### What the Author Does NOT Claim

* Institutional authority
* Final answers about intelligence
* Neutrality without accountability

Research here should be evaluated by **arguments, evidence, and reproducibility**, not by titles or affiliations.

## Closing Note

Credibility in AIC-research is not derived from prestige.

It is built from:

* Explicit responsibility
* Transparent failure
* Verifiable systems
* Long-term consistency

If this research is wrong, it should be possible to show *where*, *why*, and *how*.
