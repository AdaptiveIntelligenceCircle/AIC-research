# Credibility Layer – AIC-research

This document defines the **credibility framework** of AIC-research.
It replaces implicit trust with explicit structure, traceability, and long-term accountability.

## File: `research_timeline.md`

### Purpose

To provide a **transparent temporal record** of how ideas, systems, and assumptions evolved.

### Timeline Principles

* Chronological honesty
* No retroactive justification
* Failures are first-class milestones

### Example Structure

* Phase 0 – Conceptual questioning (motivation, early doubts)
* Phase 1 – Initial system construction (AIC core)
* Phase 2 – Recognition of control and safety limits
* Phase 3 – Introduction of introspection (IBCS)
* Phase 4 – Formalization into AIC-research

Each phase documents:

* Key questions
* Decisions made
* Assumptions later revised or abandoned

## Closing Note

Credibility in AIC-research is not derived from prestige.

It is built from:

* Explicit responsibility
* Transparent failure
* Verifiable systems
* Long-term consistency

If this research is wrong, it should be possible to show *where*, *why*, and *how*.
