# Credibility Layer – AIC-research

This document defines the **credibility framework** of AIC-research.
It replaces implicit trust with explicit structure, traceability, and long-term accountability.

## File: `verification.md`

### Purpose

To explain **how claims in AIC-research can be verified**.

### Verification Layers

1. **Code Traceability**

   * Every major claim maps to code in AIC or IBCS
   * Commits are versioned and inspectable

2. **Experiment Reproducibility**

   * Fixed seeds where applicable
   * Explicit environment assumptions
   * Long-running simulations preferred over short demos

3. **Conceptual Verifiability**

   * Clear definitions
   * Explicit scope boundaries
   * Identified failure modes

Verification is treated as an ongoing process, not a one-time checklist.

## Closing Note

Credibility in AIC-research is not derived from prestige.

It is built from:

* Explicit responsibility
* Transparent failure
* Verifiable systems
* Long-term consistency

If this research is wrong, it should be possible to show *where*, *why*, and *how*.
