# Academic Relations – AIC-research

This folder defines how **AIC-research positions itself within the global academic ecosystem**, how it relates to prior work, and how external researchers may engage with it.

Academic relations here are not driven by prestige or alignment with institutions, but by **intellectual compatibility, rigor, and responsibility**.

## File: `positioning.md`

### Purpose

To clearly state **where AIC-research stands relative to other research labs and paradigms**.

### Positioning Axes

1. Scale vs Control

   * AIC-research prioritizes controllability over scale

2. Models vs Systems

   * Focus on system-level intelligence, not isolated models

3. Training vs Runtime

   * Emphasis on long-running behavior and execution-time dynamics

4. Autonomy vs Governance

   * Intelligence is governed, not unleashed

### Non-Goals

* Competing on benchmark leaderboards
* Replacing end-to-end deep learning
* Commercial deployment without oversight

Positioning is descriptive, not adversarial.

## Closing Note

Academic relations in AIC-research are built on:

* Shared responsibility
* Intellectual honesty
* Willingness to disagree rigorously

Collaboration is welcomed, but never at the cost of clarity, safety, or accountability.
